# ðŸª™ Shares & Breakdowns

At our Solana-based NFT mint, we are committed to providing our community with a transparent and rewarding experience. To this end, we are proud to offer a 100% breakdown from Sol shares. This means that 50% of the revenue generated from NFT mints will go towards our token, which is paired with Sol, and will be staked for rewards. The other 50% will be allocated to our treasury.

During presales, shares will be split from 100%, with 70% remaining in funds for our token and 30% going towards our treasury. As for shares from the secondary market, 20% will be allocated towards our community token, while 80% will go towards our treasury.

In the near future, we will be hosting a monthly event for both our NFT holders and non-holders, and more details about this will be shared in our IRL event plans. Shares generated from events in real life (IRL) will also be included in our revenue breakdown.

We believe in fostering a strong and engaged community, and we are excited to offer a transparent and equitable revenue sharing model that benefits both our token holders and the Mud Dudes DAO as a whole.
