> Dr. SiPz was born and raised in the lower level ghettos of Solana Blvd. Despite the tough environment, he always had a passion for music, art, fashion, and the hustle. As he grew older, he became a mad scientist and a father to four beautiful little sippers, as well as his beloved Juice Queen.
>
> Dr. SiPz was a man of many talents, but he wanted to merge them into one ultimate project: a universe configuration that could modify the lower levels of Solana Blvd's ecosystem and the surrounding communities. He knew that he needed to find like-minded beings to help him spread the word, but he wasn't sure where to start.
>
> Using his street-hustler mindset and trust in the hood, Dr. SiPz came up with a plan to create a liquid drug called $SLABz for SiPPERz. The drug would transform those who sipped from the double cup, changing communities and bringing value to Solana Blvd. However, Dr. SiPz didn't fully trust random beings to distribute the drug, so he created 10,000 "Mud Dude" beings that could carry out his plans on the block for him.
>
> Before the Mud Dudes could get to work, Dr. SiPz came up with a series of web effect link connections that would tie everything together. He started a farming system for $SLABz, creating an affordable DAO pass for access to the secret farms where the hustle wouldn't start with the Mud Dudes. This allowed them more time in the mud machine.
>
> To spread his knowledge of the ideas, Dr. SiPz went to other communities and made ties with them, giving them samples of $SLABz to bring up their communities. They could choose to get more by grabbing a DAO pass from the farm pool, which granted them 3,333,000.0000 $SLABz from each pass. Dr. SiPz also created other options for Big SiPPERz.
>
> In addition to the Mud Dudes, Dr. SiPz had a small team consisting of one family member and a day one homie. Together, they shared the same goals and dreams for each other. This team had many talents in their work, and they were an integral part of the modification project.
>
> As the project moved into its next phase, the team continued to work hard to make Dr. SiPz's vision a reality. With their collective passion for music, art, fashion, and the hustle, they were determined to bring value to Solana Blvd and the surrounding communities.
