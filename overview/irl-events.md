# ðŸ¤¯ IRL EVENTS&#x20;

Sure, here's a revised version that sounds more professional:

"At the Mud Dudes DAO, we are committed to delivering an exceptional experience for our community, and we're thrilled to announce our plans for monthly events. Unlike other collections that may only host events once a year, we want to do it big every month. From small to large, we believe in providing opportunities for our holders to connect and have fun.

We recognize that not all events can be supported by the Solana ecosystem, especially if they involve music, art, or fashion. However, we are in-house and have our own medium-sized stage. In addition, creators outside of web3 can set up booths at our event for a fee, allowing them to showcase and sell their merchandise. Artists who want to perform will need to pay a fee for their slot.

All shares generated from the event will be put right back into the Mud Dudes DAO brand. Our revenue breakdown for these events will be 100% with 80% going towards the Mud Dudes DAO and 20% being allocated towards expenses related to the event.

Here's a breakdown of our plans for our monthly events:

1. Provide monthly events to our community, from small to large in scale, to foster engagement and fun.
2. Offer opportunities for creators outside of web3 to set up booths at our events for a fee, enabling them to showcase and sell their merchandise but knowing us we will try to get them and who is apart of the event to come to web3.
3. Invite artists to perform at our events, with a fee charged for their slot.
4. Allocate all shares generated from the event towards the Mud Dudes DAO brand, with 80% going towards the DAO and 20% being set aside for event-related expenses.

We believe in the power of community and are excited to provide our holders with the opportunity to come together, have fun, and engage with our brand in meaningful ways.&#x20;
