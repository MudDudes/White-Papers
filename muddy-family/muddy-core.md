## Main objective for the brand

Our overarching objective is to foster a vibrant and engaging community, and we take pride in having reached this point of our Git book by conveying our key message. Our aspiration is to create a sense of camaraderie, and our team of three co-founders is committed to delivering unparalleled service to both the local and global community. As you peruse through our platform, you will discover that we have an ambitious vision that involves promoting and supporting music artists and NFT creators. To this end, one of our co-founders is offering a remarkable artist development pack that includes various components, such as songwriting, song building, and more.

We take a comprehensive approach to artist development, as our program includes a 3-month course, culminating in a professionally shot video. We have partnered with i2R Record PR team through Ditto Music to provide comprehensive PR services for our clients. The package's cost ranges from $200 - $600 USDC / Sol dollar amount of $SLABz token, and we have made it possible to purchase the package using our token.

Before you raise your eyebrows and think that we are taking advantage of our community members, we assure you that we are matching the high-tier package's cost to ensure that our customers have a memorable experience. The package includes artist development, PR services through Ditto Music on Twitter, three art covers for the singles, a music video from our in-house cameraman, blockchain storage of the song under our label collection as 1/1s or a limited edition of 100-1000, the opportunity to perform at our muddy event, and free merchandise.

For those who are serious about elevating their music careers and seeking a nurturing and supportive community, we invite you to join us. If you do not have a record label to sign with, we welcome you to join our brand. If you hold our free mints and main mint, you are eligible for discounted rates. We are committed to matching pockets and ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed.
