# Free Mint Collections

## Why Free Mint BEFORE mean mint?!

1. Revolutionary approach to mints: We are introducing a new way of mints using our token $SLABz as a minting token. This approach is unlike anything else on the market and will change the way you think about mints.
2. Generous Airdrops and Giveaways: We are offering airdrops and giveaways of 10.5 million $SLABz for follows, retweets plus likes, and <mark style="background-color:purple;">70.5 million</mark> for comments on what you read about the white papers (<mark style="background-color:orange;">secrete open to use</mark>). This provides an opportunity for you to get your hands on our token without any investment.
3. Revenue share model and NFT grants: We have implemented a revenue share model, where 70% of the revenue generated will be distributed to our holders, while the remaining 30% will be allocated to the main project. We are also offering a limited number of NFT grants to WL holders, with a maximum limit of 15 grantees. These unique projects will serve different purposes and offer exclusive perks to the main project's holders.
4. Whale and enjoy perks of Mud Dudes DAO: Whether you want to whale your way to flip on the secondary market or hold to enjoy some of the perks of Mud Dudes DAO, there is something for everyone. With a mint price of one million $SLABz, you can get involved in our project and enjoy the benefits of being part of our community.
5.  Attention artists! We are thrilled to announce a new project that we believe will appeal to your creativity and values. We are seeking a talented, like-minded artist to collaborate with us on our free mint collection initiative. Our goal is to offer unique, one-of-a-kind art pieces in your style that will stand out in the marketplace.

    We are committed to supporting our artist partners and will compensate you for your work with secondary market royalties. We believe in empowering artists by providing a platform to showcase their work and gain exposure to new audiences.
